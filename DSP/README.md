# Digital Signal Processing
A revision/background paper covering the mathematics and algorithms relating to Digital Signal Processing and the Fourier Transform.  

The code for the majority of plots found in the paper can be found in the CodeForImages folder.

Also contained within the CodeFor Images folder is a folder called 'Circuits' which contains Jupyter Notebooks which captures, in code, the key lessons from edX's [Circuits and Electronics MOOC](https://www.edx.org/course/circuits-electronics-mitx-6-002x-1).

In addition, there is a folder titled 'CodeForHeatEquation' which contains Jupyter Notebooks from Lorena Barba's MOOC, [Practical Numerical Methods in Python](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:MAE+MAE6286+2017/about), which uses Euler's formula, the Taylor Series, explicit and implicit Finite Difference Methods and Linear Algebra to solve the Heat Equation.
