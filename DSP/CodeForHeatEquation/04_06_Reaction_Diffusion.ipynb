What are they?  The name says it allâ€”it's a system that has the physics of diffusion but also has some kind of reaction that adds different behaviors to the solution.\n",

Some amazing patterns can emerge with simple reaction models, eerily reminiscent of patterns formed in nature. It's fascinating! Check out this simulation by Karl Sims posted on You Tube ... it looks like a growing coral reef, doesn't it?"

The reaction requires one unit of $U$ and two units of $V$,  resulting in a reaction rate proportional to the concentration $u$ and to the square of the concentration $v$. This result derives from the _law of mass action_, which we can explain in terms of probability: the odds of finding one molecule of species $U$ at a point in space is proportional to the concentration $u$, while the odds of finding two molecules of $V$ is proportional to the concentration squared, $v^2$. We assume here a reaction rate constant equal to $1$, which just means that the model is non-dimensionalized in some way.\n",
