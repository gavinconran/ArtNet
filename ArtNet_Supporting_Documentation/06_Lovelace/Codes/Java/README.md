# Java (mostly)
Over the years I have taken a number of Java related courses and the following folders contain code from my Eclipse IDE 'workspace'. 
### ClientServer (Masters @ UU)
### Database (Masters @ UU)
### Algorithms (MOOC @ Princeton && MOOC @ Melbourne)
### Software Engineering (MOOC @ MIT)
