# Fourier
A revision/background paper covering the mathematics and algorithms relating to Digital Signal Processing and the Fourier Transform.  

The code for the majority of plots found in the paper can be found in the CodeForImages folder.

Also contained within the CodeFor Images folder is a folder called 'Circuits' which contains Jupyter Notebooks which captures, in code, the key lessons from edX's [Circuits and Electronics MOOC](https://www.edx.org/course/circuits-electronics-mitx-6-002x-1).

# Taylor
In addition, I adapted code from Lorena Barba's MOOC, [Practical Numerical Methods in Python](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:MAE+MAE6286+2017/about), which uses Euler's formula, the Taylor Series, the Crank-Nicolson implicit Finite Difference Method and Linear Algebra to numerically solve the Heat Equation.
