# ArtNet
This directory contains the paper "ArtNet:An Art Image Classifier fine-tuned from pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks" and supporting code.

To run you must first install TensorFlow, preferably in a virtual environment [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux].
The shell script, retrainHub_InceptionV4, calls the python program, retrain.py.
