We know explicit schemes have stability constraints that might make them impractical in some cases, due to requiring a very small time step. Implicit schemes are unconditionally stable, offering the advantage of larger time steps; in [notebook 2](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/04_spreadout/04_02_Heat_Equation_1D_Implicit.ipynb), we look at the 1D implicit solution of diffusion. Already, that was quite a lot of work: setting up a matrix of coefficients and a right-hand-side vector, while taking care of the boundary conditions, and then solving the linear system. And now, we want to do implicit schemes in 2Dâ€”are you ready for this challenge?"
